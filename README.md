# mrtgLikeRRD
mrtgLikeRRD is a collection of scripts to emulate creation of MRTG like pages while using RRDTool as a backend.
Currently, there is no installation or assisted configuration, everything needs to be done manually. The scripts are currently tested on Debian 10.
At the moment, I don't have any plans to support other OS or to create any installation or configuration scripts. If you like mrtgLikeRRD, feel free to contact me, perhaps we can find a way for improvements together.
